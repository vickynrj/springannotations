Core Spring Framework Annotations


********** 
@Required: It applies to the bean setter method. It indicates that the annotated bean must be populated at configuration time with the required property, else it throws an exception BeanInitilizationException.


**********
@Controller
We can annotate classic controllers with the @Controller annotation. This is simply a specialization of the @Component class, which allows us to auto-detect implementation classes through the classpath scanning.

We typically use @Controller in combination with a @RequestMapping annotation for request handling methods.
